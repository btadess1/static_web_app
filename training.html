The trainings we organize include, drivers training, computer literacy training, Certified Nursing Assistance training (CNA), Database Administration and Development courses, and Auto-mechanics specialization. The drivers training course includes two weeks lecture session and driver’s skill training on the road. We also provide a car for MVA tests, with no additional cost, if the person who wanted the car took any kind of class in our training center. We can also arrange individual divers training programs and DUI trainings on weekends. We also give Basic English language training for the community members free of charge through our charity and volunteer programs. Our language program extends to train the children of the community, how to write, speak, listen the Amharic language.</p>

<p class="accessibility"><img class="img" src="image/train1.jpg" alt="our community library" width="140" height="105">
Our Auto-mechanics specialization courses are intended to the community members, who have experience working as mechanics or auto-electricians for more than two years, or any community member, who is trained to become auto-mechanic or auto-electrician in any form al training facility, but does not have any work experience. This training is a three-month intensive training that extends from the basics to advanced level. Our database administration and development course is for community members, who have some level of experience in computer programming languages. Individuals, who have knowledge of any object-oriented programming language like Java are expected to benefit more from this course. In addition, those who have a background in any database administrative and development toll are likely to succeed in the program.</p>
