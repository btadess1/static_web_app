<h2>Thank you Letters from Our Customers</h2>
<br><br>

<h3>Eyob Hanna and Rebeca Gezahegn</h3>
<p class="accessibility">You made our day special and wonderful. We are happy for deciding
to go with you. Everything was just as you promised it to be. 
The food, the music, the flowers, starting from the coordination, 
was wonderful. That is way we took time to write you this thank 
you letter.</p>
<br><br>

<h3>Abeba Desalegn and Gedy Yehdego</h3>
<p class="accessibility">Thanks to you, our wedding was one of the best cultural weddings 
in Washington DC. The way you coordinated the event in a short 
notice, and the way you treated all our gests was exceptional. 
You guys are simply the best wedding planners in our community.</p>
<br><br>

<h3>Haile Desalegn and his Family</h3>

<p class="accessibility">You guys were like close friends to me and my children during 
our hardest day of the year. Though it was the passing away 
of my late hose that brought us together. I found you not 
only as excellent professionals, but also great personalities, 
who care and dare to make the hard things easy. Thank you for 
being there and taking care of all the funeral process with 
such decency.</p>
